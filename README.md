# Kadeillian.com README

This is my personal website that I created in order to share my web development journey and to show potential employers some of what I am able to do.  The website is viewable at <http://www.kadeillian.com>.  I try to post blogs regularly to keep track of what I have been working on, to help other new developers in their web development journey, and to write about coding topics that I find interesting.  Feel free to download this code locally and to run it in your own environment!  To do so: follow the guide below:
1. Download Ruby 3.1.1 to your machine and make sure that your run conditions are set to it.
2. Download Rails 7.0.
